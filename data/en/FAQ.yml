title: FAQ
question_1: Is it possible to keep the format of the original document?
answer_1: We guarantee all possible formats in document delivery. If the original
  file is editable (e.g. Word, PDF, InDesign, etc.), we overwrite the original language.
  If it is not (e.g. images), we reformat it (DTP) at an additional cost of $25 per
  hour. In the case of websites, we translate over the source code directly.
question_2: How do you choose your translators?
answer_2: We only use translators who are native speakers of the target language.
  We have translators who are experienced in various fields and are proficient in
  the subject of the translation and writing in the target language. We choose them
  according to the requirements of the project and the needs of the client.
question_3: How much does a translation cost?
answer_3: The average price of our translations is 0.10 USD cents per word from the
  original document. This rate will vary depending on the difficulty of the text to
  be translated, the time required for delivery, the format in which it is delivered,
  and the language combination.
question_4: What are the payment methods?
answer_4: We require 50% of the full price to be paid upfront at the beginning of
  the job and 50% upon delivery. For reoccurring clients, we can accept payment of
  the remaining 50% within 30 days of delivery.  We accept bank transfers and PayPal.
