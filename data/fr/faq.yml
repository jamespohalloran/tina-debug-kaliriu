q_a:
- question: What is interface design?
  answer: Interface design is the process designers go through to create interfaces,
    focusing on appearance and style. This means, they design all the graphic elements,
    with colors and typographies that help the user to "communicate" with a system.
- question: What is the goal of an interface design?
  answer: The objective of the designers who create the user interface is to make
    it easy for the potential clients to interact with the website and stay on it
    for as long as possible. This influences the SEO ranking of the company and the
    goal it has in the market, whether it is to sell a product or establish a service.
- question: What is the difference between interface design and user experience?
  answer: Interface design and user experience differ from each other because the
    first one refers to the design of a website page or application, where the construction
    of it is implemented with colors, typographies and visual design in general. While
    the second one refers to the usability and ease of navigation for users (easy
    and intuitive).
- question: How does the design process work?
  answer: The design process begins when the designers in charge identify user requirements,
    among other things. Once this process is carried out, the different viable options
    are created and analyzed, and the objectives and actions that the interface should
    have been defined. Icons, descriptive texts, windows, titles, and other tools
    are used to make the prototype and evaluate its quality.
- question: What are the biggest trends in the UI/UX design industry at the moment?
  answer: 'There are some trends in the UI/UX design industry at the moment and they
    are as follows: dark mode (reduces eyestrain, saves device power, highlights design
    elements), shadows, layers and floating elements, storytelling (closeness to users),
    empty space (active or passive), voice UI, photo production, fonts, text and copy,
    3D, and VR.'
- question: 'When a client says: "I don''t like this design", what does the designer
    do?'
  answer: The objective of the designer in charge of carrying out the design of a
    website or application of a company is to make sure the client loves it, and when
    this does not happen, the designer will do it again until the client is satisfied
    with the final result.
- question: Guide me through a design example in which you set out to solve a business
    problem.
  answer: When there is a business problem, design professionals review the construction
    of the website or application based on the information available to them. The
    goal is to find the perfect balance between the problem and the design process
    being carried out. The design is modified, as well as considering the user's experience.
- question: What does it mean to be a great UI/UX designer?
  answer: UI/UX design is a profession that is currently trending and professionals
    in the sector are responsible for creating and developing interfaces that meet
    the needs of users, with the aim of offering them a unique, simple, and intuitive
    experience. These professionals are considered great UI/UX designers.
- question: Would investing in UI/UX design increase my ROI?
  answer: ROI (return on investment) has to do with the amount of money that is generated
    after investing, in this case in a UI/UX design. It evaluates the profitability
    of the benefit/investment. Does it improve the final result? Of course it does,
    UI/UX processes increase ROI because they keep customers engaged with a company's
    service and product.
- question: How long does it usually take to design a website?
  answer: The time it takes depends a lot on the complexity of the website to be developed,
    but the minimum is two days, since it also depends on the deadlines for review,
    approval, and final adjustments. These points also influence the final budget
    of the website or application. Each design is different, so each one has a unique
    structure and time.
- question: 'How many changes can I expect on my site at no additional cost? '
  answer: Once the designer presents the final result to the client, it may happen
    that the client does not like some aspects of the website or application and requests
    some changes. These changes, if they are minor, will have no additional cost.
    If the changes required are large, the designer will evaluate what is the appropriate
    amount to charge.
- question: 'How does the payment process work for a UI/UX design? '
  answer: 'The UI/UX designer carries out different stages during the creation and
    development of the website or application, which are the following: research and
    analysis, creation, implementation, and follow-up. Therefore, the client who requests
    the work must pay 50% at the beginning of the work and the remaining 50% when
    the final result is delivered.'
- question: What is the participation of a company in the design process?
  answer: 'Companies or clients of any industry have an important role in the design
    process of a website or application because they are the ones in charge of transmitting
    in a clear way what they want to obtain from the design developed team. For example:
    to sell a product, to establish a service, etc.'
- question: What are the benefits of a good UI/UX design?
  answer: With a good UX design you can increase sales, retain the user, reduce costs,
    increase web traffic, satisfy customers, and improve SEO.
