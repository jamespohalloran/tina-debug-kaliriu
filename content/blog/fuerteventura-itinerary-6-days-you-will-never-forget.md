We went in December and it was warm enough to spend the day at the beach in a bikini. It can be very windy though. According to [holiday-weather.com](https://www.holiday-weather.com/fuerteventura/averages/ \"https://www.holiday-weather.com/fuerteventura/averages/\"), the coldest month is **January at 18°C (64°F)**, and the warmest is **August with an average temperature of 25°C (77°F)**.\n\n### Arriving to Fuerteventura\n\nFuerteventura has an airport (FUE), which serves several major European cities as well as Spanish destinations such as Valencia and Barcelona. I took an airplane from Valencia to Fuerteventura with Ryanair, and bought them through [kayak.com](https://www.kayak.com/ \"Kayak.com\"). We went in mid-december and the total cost was **126.50 EUR for two people.**\n\n### Getting Around in Fuerteventura\n\nMost places are only accesible by car, so I recommend that **you rent a car** to get the most out of your stay. We rented a car using [doyouspain.com](www.doyouspain.com \"www.doyouspain.com\"), **with a total cost of 232.27 EUR from December 11 - 18.** Gasoline costs was **50 EUR.**\n\n### Where To Stay in Fuerteventura\n\nYou can find an Airbnb in Fuerteventura for as little as 17 EUR a night. We found a place to stay in **Puerto del Rosario** (right next to the Airport) **for a total of 326 EUR for 7 days.**\n\n### Total Cost of a 7-Day Trip in Fuerteventura\n\nArriving to Fuerteventura + renting a car + Airbnb costs was a total of **734.77 EUR** for two people. Adding to it a boat that took us to Isla de los Lobos (**16 EUR per person**), and grocery shopping and restaurants at around **200 EUR**. The total cost for the whole trip was around **966.77 EUR.**\n\n## Day 1: Barranco Encantado\n\nThe narrow orange canyons of fossilized sand are truly impressive, and they date back to more than 135 thousand years. You will need a car to arrive and then hike and walk the whole way through.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddtcgm4kc/image/upload/v1639944889/324234_wh8utq.jpg)\n\nWe arrived by searching for Barranco Encantado in Google Maps, parking the car by the road and then following the path up the mountain. The hike to arrive was around 30 to 40 minutes. There is no mobile signal so be careful not to get lost, and bring good hiking shoes and water. There is generally more tourists taking the same route so we were able to ask for directions.\n\nWhen we went, there were little piles of rocks that showed we were on the right path.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddtcgm4kc/image/upload/v1639941763/20211212_142743_fd7yzy.jpg)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddtcgm4kc/image/upload/v1639941786/20211212_143035_dqvmmf.jpg)\n\n## Day 2: Calderon Hondo & Corralejo Sand Dunes\n\n**Calderon Hondo is an inactive volcano**. You can search it directly on Google Maps, which will take you on a dirt road to a parking spot and then you will have to walk and hike the volcano. It is about a 30 minute hike, with lots of rocks and squirrels.\n\nAfter a long morning hike, we decided to picnic in the Corralejo Sand Dunes.\n\nIf you are lucky, you may find a little rock nest that has not been taken yet. It was the first time I ever saw these at the beach. but it seemed quite a common thing to do in the island.\n\n## Day 3: Ajuy Black Sand Beach & Astronomical Viewpoint Sicasumbre\n\nAfter two days of hiking and walking we decided to go for a more chilled day and enjoy a picnic at the beach in Ajuy.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddtcgm4kc/image/upload/v1639942052/4334_zbizjc.jpg)\n\nAfter spending a relaxing day at the beach we decided to finish it off by enjoying the astronomical viewpoint at Sicasumbre. It provides a fantastic view of many mountains, giving it a very unique photo opportunity.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddtcgm4kc/image/upload/v1639942069/456456_ioho7p.jpg)\n\n## Day 4: Arco de las Peñitas & Playa de Sotavento\n\nAfter a relaxing day we were ready to hike again and find the Arco de las Peñitas. Located in the Barranco de las Peñitas, there is an incredible natural arch. It's not the simplest spot to locate, nor is it the easiest to get to. [Click here to find the closest parking spot before the hike.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xEiAvBMHm3kA1EzH6)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddtcgm4kc/image/upload/v1639941878/20211214_144452_njx3ff.jpg)\n\nAt the end of the day we decided to relax at Playa de Sotavento, a very wide beach that is a magnificent paradise with about 6 kilometers of white sand beaches and turquoise water. You can see how the tides change, forming lagoons. It is unquestionably one of Fuerteventura's most unforgettable locations.\n\n\\--\n\n## Day 5: Lobos Island\n\nOne of the top things to do in Fuerteventura is to take the 15 minute ferry from Corralejo to Lobos Island. We bought our tickets [here](https://www.rentaguidecanarias.com/ferry-a-lobos).\n\nLobos Island has a distinctive environment of salt marshes, volcanic mounds, stunning beaches, and natural pools.\n\nThe Playa de la Concha and the Puertito Isla De Lobos are two of Lobos Island's most picturesque spots.\n\n\\--\n\n## Day 6: Aguas Verdes & Popcorn Beach\n\nAguas Verdes translates to \"green pools.\" The pools are buried amongst stunning black volcanic rock and make for beautiful photos.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddtcgm4kc/image/upload/v1639941948/454564_i7vrl3.jpg)\n\nPopcorn Beach (Playa del Bajo de la Burra) is a beach with washed up coral that look like popcorn. They are hard to lay on but there are also sandy areas if you want to sit and relax there for a moment.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddtcgm4kc/image/upload/v1639941849/20211218_123847_uo47sf.jpg)\n\n## Day 7: Playa del Aguila\n\nThe Playa del Aguila, located in the west of the island near El Cotillo, is another must-see beach in Fuerteventura."
