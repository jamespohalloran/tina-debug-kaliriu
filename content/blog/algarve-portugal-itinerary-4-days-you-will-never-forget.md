description = "## 4-Day Itinerary for Algarve\n\n* Day 1: Praia de Odeceixe & Sagres\n* Day 2: Benagil Caves & Praia da Marinha\n* Day 3: Spa Day at Hotel California & Visit Albufeira Town\n* Day 4: Praia dos Estudiantes & Praia do Camilo\n\nWe stayed in an Airbnb in Lagos for **4 nights for a total of 320 EUR**. We went in the beginning of November, where it was still warm enough to go to the beach. The highest temperature being **20°C (68°F)**. According to [responsibletravel.com](https://www.responsibletravel.com/holidays/algarve/travel-guide/best-time-to-visit-the-algarve \"https://www.responsibletravel.com/holidays/algarve/travel-guide/best-time-to-visit-the-algarve\"), **April - June is the best time to visit the Algarve.**\n\n## Day 1: Praia de Odeceixe & Sagres\n\nOdeceixe Beach has to be one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen. It is a magnificent paradise of white sand and turquoise water. Perfect to start the day with a walk along the mountain and finish it off with a picnic by the shore.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddtcgm4kc/image/upload/v1639948211/06-01_eugyay.jpg)\n\nAfter spending the day at the beach, we went to Sagres to watch the sunset. It has a lighthouse, where you can go in and there's a small gift shop and restaurants.\n\n## Day 2: Benagil Caves & Praia da Marinha\n\nIf you search Benagil Caves on Google Maps it will take you to a mountain where you can observe it from above. It is a beautiful short hike where you can take a look at the surrounding beaches from up top.\n\nTo enter the Benagil Caves you will have to go to Benagil Beach and take a boat or kayak. We reserved one a boat on the spot and the duration was around 30 minutes. Keep in mind that if you go by boat they will not let you get out on to the beach. Technically, you could arrive by swimming, but it is not recommended unless you're a profesional swimmer. And if the waves are particularly dangerous that day, it is recommended you take the boat instead of a kayak or paddleboard. \n\nMarinha Beach is not far away and is one of the most famous beaches in the Algarve. The perfect location to end the day.\n\n## Day 3: Spa Day at Hotel California & Visit Albufeira Town\n\nWe booked a couple hours at [the Spa in Hotel California](https://detailshotels.com/en/california/dspa/) to start the day refreshed. It has a heated indoor pool with a thermal water circuit and a Turkish bath. \n\nAfter spending the morning at the spa, we walked downtown Albufeira, to have dinner with the view of the beach and the gift shops.\n\n## Day 4: Praia dos Estudantes & Praia do Camilo\n\nThese two beaches are the perfect place to relax and take Insta-worthy photos. Students Beach in Lagos is surrounded by cliffs, through which two tunnels have been excavated: one to the west, which leads to a small beach, and the other to the east, which leads to a larger beach. There's a lovely arch that connects one of the rocks to the mainland. The other tunnel connects the beaches of Praia dos Estudiantes and Praia da Batata."
