  title: What Solo Travel Has Taught Me
  description: 'Solo travel boosted my self-confidence. I became aware of what I''m
    capable of, and that I can handle most difficult situations. I''ve had to overcome
    a lot, but it serves as a reminder that I''m a lot stronger than I think for when
    I''m going through hard times. '
  description_2: My priorities changed. I had to take care of myself, which meant
    keeping only the things that I need, and leave anything else so that I could travel
    light. It forced me to live a minimalist lifestyle which made me value experiences
    over things.
