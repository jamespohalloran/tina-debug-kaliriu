  text: "Paladria is a company created by multi-generational and multi-cultural women
    aimed at enriching your message for a global reach.\n\nLed by a multi-lingual
    mother and her daughters, Paladria has seen for years how the misinterpretation
    of ideas can go viral and reduce the possibilities for a global change and fruitful
    business. We offer more than translation services; we will solve problems and
    lead you on the path to expanding your horizons to other cultures and countries.\n
    \nIt’s not “business as usual” with Paladria. We erase obsolete paradigms in business
    and replace them with understandings and perspectives that better serve people
    in a world progressing  towards a more responsible and assertive perspective.
    We hold ourselves accountable in expressing, sharing, and clarifying your message.
    We care about your intention as we guide you through every stage of the message-building
    process. \n"

  title: Our Origins
  text: "Our background supports us\n\nAdriana Aristizabal arrived in the United States
    28 years ago. As a Latina newcomer knowing her native language, Spanish and fluent
    French, she realized that translating, removing language barriers, and helping
    different cultures to communicate with each other was her passion. She already
    knew how to adapt to new cultures after working as Creative Director for advertising
    agencies in several countries. With her first computer and  great ambition, she
    started translating for an industrial-scale company.  Since then she has translated
    more than 60 books for different publishers.\n\nFollowing their mother's linguistic
    and entrepreneurial footsteps, her daughters studied languages and marketing.
    They  garnered professional experience and knowledge through their work and travel
    across Europe and the Americas.\nWith this business and educational background,
    Adriana and her daughters combine a modern perspective to a respected translation
    tradition that opens doors of opportunity and best fits your needs. Paladria’s
    guarantee of quality includes permanent assistance in every step of the way to
    get excellent results.\n\nWe are a multigenerational and committed team, with
    the necessary knowledge, experience, and technological and linguistic understanding
    needed to turn each project into its equivalent language, revealing the essence
    of your message.\n\nPaladria navigates among cultures and languages.  Let us speak
    your language. We want to hear from you, and share this trip together. "
