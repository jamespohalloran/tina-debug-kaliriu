  Nowadays, most people, before making the purchase of a product will research on the Internet from the comfort of their own home before going out to visit the stores. That is why companies need to offer their customers a good and intuitive interface design.

  Social networks and different electronic devices are growing and changing every day. These changes force companies to stop and implement strategies to integrate them and compete with the rest. In fact, many people find YOUR company for the first time through the web.

  UI/UX designers are in charge of creating a conscious design that will rank the website on the Internet so that it becomes among the best in their industry (SEO). Let's remember that when a user spends a long time on a certain page, it is because they like it and find it easy to navigate. That is what we are looking for.

  ## What Is an Interface?

  Before continuing on with the impact that interface design has on companies, it is important to define what an interface is in order to understand in depth what we are talking about.

  Believe it or not, in everyday life we are interacting with different interfaces all the time, but it turns out that many times we do not know how they work, and this is because their design is not the best. When this happens, the user usually gets frustrated and immediately closes the page in search of another one.

  This is what a company needs to avoid, which is why it is so valuable to create an interface that is simple, intuitive, and where users can quickly achieve the objective for which they entered.

  Having said all this, it is clear that the success of a company's interface depends a lot on the purpose for which it was designed for and also on the type of user it is aimed at. Regardless of this, it must be easy to use and understand.

  ## Benefits of Having a Good User Interface Design for Your Business

  As we mentioned at the beginning, the interface is extremely important for a company, since it is not only about the website that the user will see on the screen, but also the experience they have from the moment they search on Google.

  Business owners should know that the user interface design can affect both positively and negatively. A good web design will make the product competitive.

  Here are the benefits of having a good user interface for your business:

  ### SEO Ranking

  A high-ranking website is what most companies are looking for. One of the ways that it can be achieved is by having a great user interface design.

  Internet search engines calculate the time in which the user remains on a certain website and the relevance that it has for the search they performed. The objective is that the user stays on the site for as long as possible, which would indicate that it is easy to navigate.

  ### Clarity For Your Users

  Although this may seem more of a benefit to the users, it is not. Companies must be clear and precise about who they are and what they offer. By achieving that, they will be able to design a good interface that meets the users' expectations.

  In short, the goal of every company is to achieve an interface design that accurately communicates what they want to offer.

  ### First Impressions

  In different aspects of life, first impressions get in the way of people's decisions, and a company's website is no exception. That is why it is key that the interface design is good, catches the eye and above all is intuitive.

  The content must be clear, separated by sections, where the user can clearly understand what they are seeing.

  ### Websites: Must Remain Intuitive and Easy To Use

  The design of a company's interface must focus on the user, so that he/she feels satisfied when staying on the site. It is essential that people entering the website can understand in a few steps how to use it without problems.

  This is why UI/UX designers, when performing the corresponding tests, put themselves in the place of the user who enters the interface for the first time, a simple way to corroborate the proper functioning.

  ### Direct Communication and Easy Access

  Of course, any user when making a purchase on a website needs to feel secure during the process and also in the previous and subsequent steps. Therefore, the interface must contain a means of direct contact with the customer, this generates confidence, and you will gain more visits.

  ### User Experience

  The design of the interface must also be designed so that the user can use it from any electronic device, this will produce a better user experience, which is a fundamental aspect for the customer.

  Another point to consider is, as the company grows, the interface covers different types of users, therefore, an alternative is to add tutorials (which can be omitted), for those who need some help.

  ### Harmonious Design

  Throughout the entire interface, the design must remain coherent so that the user, as he/she advances, feels that he/she is in the same place and associates the company with its own style.

  The content and information added must be relevant and well distributed. Harmony will benefit the company to obtain a more professional image.

  ### Customers: Attracting and Retaining Them

  There is no doubt that the main objective of any company is to attract and retain customers, so the good interface design is essential for this to happen.

  When a person enters the web for the first time, he/she wants to find easily and quickly what he/she is looking for, if this happens, he/she will come back again.
