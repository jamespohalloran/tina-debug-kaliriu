It includes the way people feel about their interactions with it and their perceptions of its value.\n\nIn order to create a successful user experience, you need to focus on three key principles:\n\n1. Simplicity \n2. Relevance\n3. Usability\n\n### UX Design for Mobile Devices vs Desktop Devices\n\nThe use of mobile devices has increased drastically over the past few years. It is now a part of our daily lives, from checking emails to watching videos. With this increase in usage, it's important to design for these devices with a user-centric approach.\n\nMobile UX design is different than desktop UX design because there are less physical constraints such as screen size and resolution. Mobile designers have the freedom to create interfaces that are more creative and adaptive than their desktop counterparts.\n\nMobile UX designers have to consider how content can be accessed on a smaller screen without compromising the user experience or content quality."
