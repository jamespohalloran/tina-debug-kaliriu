Of course, the company is the one making the investment and therefore it is important to measure the results by mapping specific metrics.\n\nAs we have been mentioning, user-centric UX/UI designs increase ROI and keep customers engaged with a given product or service.

A statistic that demonstrates this is a study conducted by the American management consulting firm Bain & Company, which states that a 10% increase in loyal users increases the value of your company by 30%.\n\n## What are the UI/UX design indicators to know if it increases my ROI?\n\nUI/UX design professionals take into account the interests and objectives of the company in order to build a good usability experience, we can help you achieve it, contact us!\n\nIn order to know if your ROI increases, you can take into account the following indicators:\n\n* Higher conversion rate, brand loyalty and customer retention (purchase frequency).\n* Reduced time to market, complaints, time to complete tasks by users.\n* Improved customer satisfaction rates.\n* The number of sales increases, as well as by product.
