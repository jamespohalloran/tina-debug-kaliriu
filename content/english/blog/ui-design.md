description = "Did you know that a UI/UX designer is in charge of developing and creating intuitive and simple interfaces according to the needs and tastes of the users of a product or service? Currently, this profession is a trend, because professional UI/IX designers are able to simplify computer systems for users in the case of websites, applications, software, etc.\n\nIn short, they are experts in designing a customer's experience in the best way. Before continuing, it is important to differentiate between UI and UX. The first acronym refers to the creation of the interface (graphical or developed in CSS, HTML, etc.), while the second is the user experience.\n\nAs we can see, **the work of a UI/UX designer is divided into two complementary and necessary stages to achieve the best possible experience.** In fact, these professionals also consider the trends of the moment, for example, nowadays soft colors and dark mode are used on the screen to enhance the experience.\n\nSimilarly, bolder typographies are used, not as classic as in previous years. On the screen, the user will only see the most relevant elements accompanied by animations. Static pages have been forgotten!"
